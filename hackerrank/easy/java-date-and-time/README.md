# Java Date and Time

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

The [Calendar class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week.
***

You are given a date. You just need to write the method, $getDay$, which returns the *day* on that date.  To simplify your task, we have provided a portion of the code in the editor. 

**Example**   
$month = 8$   
$day = 14$    
$year = 2017$   

The method should return $MONDAY$ as the day on that date.

**Function Description**   

Complete the *findDay* function in the editor below.   

*findDay* has the following parameters:   

- *int:* month   
- *int:* day   
- *int:* year   

**Returns**   

- *string:* the day of the week in capital letters   

**Input Format**

A single line of input containing the space separated month, day and year, respectively, in $MM$ $DD$ $YYYY$ format.




**Constraints**

* $ 2000 < year < 3000 $

**Output Format**

```java


class Result {

    /*
     * Complete the 'findDay' function below.
     *
     * The function is expected to return a STRING.
     * The function accepts following parameters:
     *  1. INTEGER month
     *  2. INTEGER day
     *  3. INTEGER year
     */

    public static String findDay(int month, int day, int year) {
        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(year, month - 1, day);

String[] days = {
    "SUNDAY", "MONDAY", "TUESDAY", "WEDNESDAY",
    "THURSDAY", "FRIDAY", "SATURDAY"
};

return days[cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK) - 1];
    }

}


```
