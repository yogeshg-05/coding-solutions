# Nested Lists

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given the names and grades for each student in a class of $N$ students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

**Note:** If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

**Example**  
$records = [[\text{"chi"}, 20.0], [\text{"beta"}, 50.0], [\text{"alpha"}, 50.0]]$

The ordered list of scores is $[20.0, 50.0]$, so the second lowest score is $50.0$.  There are two students with that score: $[\text{"beta", "alpha"}]$.  Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:
<pre>
alpha
beta
</pre>

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, $N$, the number of students. 	
The $2N$ subsequent lines describe each student over $2$ lines.  
- The first line contains a student's name.  
- The second line contains their grade. 


**Constraints**

- $2 \le N \le 5$  
- There will always be one or more students having the second lowest grade. 

**Output Format**

Print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade in. If there are multiple students, order their names alphabetically and print each one on a new line.

```py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    students = []

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        students.append([name, score])

    # Get unique scores and find the second lowest
    scores = sorted(set(score for name, score in students))
    second_lowest = scores[1]

    # Get names with second-lowest score
    names = sorted(name for name, score in students if score == second_lowest)

    for name in names:
        print(name)

```
