/*
    Enter your query here and follow these instructions:
    1. Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.
    2. The AS keyword causes errors, so follow this convention: "Select t.Field From table1 t" instead of "select t.Field From table1 AS t"
    3. Type your code immediately after comment. Don't leave any blank line.
*/
SELECT t.*
FROM CITY t
WHERE t.POPULATION > 100000
  AND t.COUNTRYCODE = 'USA';
