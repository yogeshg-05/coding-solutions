## Problem

Kevin and Stuart want to play the '__The Minion Game__'.<br>


__Game Rules__<br>

Both players are given the same string, $S$.<br>
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string $S$.<br>
Stuart has to make words starting with *consonants*.<br>
Kevin has to make words starting with *vowels*. <br>
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.
<br>


__Scoring__<br>
A player gets `+1` point for each occurrence of the substring in the string $S$.<br>

**For Example**:<br>
String $S$ = *BANANA*<br>
Kevin's vowel beginning word = *ANA*<br>
Here, *ANA* occurs twice in *BANANA*. Hence, Kevin will get `2` Points.
